# The Domains Project

Free, open-source subdomains for developers and creators — starting with `owns.it.com`.

> Inspired by [is-a.dev](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register) and [js.org](https://github.com/js-org/js.org)

---

## What is this?

The Domains Project offers developer-friendly subdomains under curated root domains.

You can register a subdomain like:

> yourname.owns.it.com


No forms. No dashboards. Just fork, configure a JSON file, and open a pull request.

---

## How it works

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Add** a config file to the `domains/` folder (e.g. `yourname.json`)
3. **Submit** a pull request
4. **Get merged**, and your subdomain goes live

See the full [Get Started guide](https://yourdomain.com/getting-started) for details.
